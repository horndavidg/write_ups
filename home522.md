###List and describe each of the primitive data types (number, string, Boolean, null, undefined). What do they each represent?Number: a numeric value that can be multiplied, divided and inserted to all types of calculations.String: a string is represented by "" around some type of value. A string is also immutable.Boolean: Booleans are usually part of a conditional statement and involve something either being true or false.Null: represents a nonexistent value.Undefined: this represents that a variable has yet to be assigned a value. ###Explain what a variable is.A variable is a container for storing data values.###Describe in precise terms what’s happening with variable assignment using “var keyword”, “identifier”, “value”, “assign” etc…Using the "var" keyword you can assign a variable (phrase) a given content/value. This content/value will be kept inside (identified by) the given variable until the program finishes executing or until the given variable is reassigned to a different content/value.  ###Evaluate the following expression: !(typeof(9) === typeof(9.5) && (99 == "99" || !true))False###Use a for loop to iterate through an array.```var arr = [array]for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){arr[i];};```###Define functions using declarations and expressions.A function declaration is a named function that does not require a variable assignment. These functions are also available to their parent scope. ```function pig() {return "oink!";};```A function expression is a function that is part of a larger syntax and assigned to a variable. The function contained in the variable can be named or anonymous but it is not visible outside of its own scope.  ```var pig = function() {return "oink!";}:```###Articulate the difference between defining and invoking a function.Defining a function simply tells the program what to do when the given function is called. It can give the function a name or leave it anonymous. It can also list whether or not the given function will take parameters and can also include other functions. Invoking a function is when you tell the program to run a given function and provide parameters if necessary. There are a couple different ways of invoking functions and functions can even invoke themselves. ###Describe how data flows into a function (by passing in arguments).There are a couple different ways that data can flow into a function. It can be passed in as a parameter:```function dog(Parameter 1, Parameter 2){};```or it can be passed in by using arguments within the function. If this is the case then it is important to keep scope in mind so that you don't call on variables that are not accessible.###Describe how data flows out of functions (by using the return keyword).A function does not return and/or show anything unless you tell it to. Simply writing an equation like a + b will not return the sum unless you tell it to. If you want a value to be extracted from a function then you have to use the "return" keyword. The user will not see this  value (you can always console.log it) but you will be able to use it outside of the function in originated form.###"Functions are just values" - explain.Basically the purpose of a function is to take in a set of variables/values, run a set equation and/or argument on them, then return a value. Therefore, you could simply look at functions as the values they return.###Write functions that return values.```function sum(a,b) {return a+b;};```###Write functions that have side effects, such as logging to the console or manipulating DOM.```document.body.addEventListener("click", function() {console.log("You clicked me!");this.style.background = "blue";  });```###Explain the difference between locally-scoped and globally scoped variables and write examples of each.Locally-scoped variables are only available within their given scope and to their children (or nested scopes). ```function() {var dog = "woof!";};```The variable dog will only be available within its given function and if you try to access it outside of that nothing will be returned. On the other hand, globally scoped variables are available across the entire document. ```var dog = "woof!";function() {};```Because the variable dog is declared outside of a functional scope, in the global space, it becomes a global variable and is therefore globally accessible.###Define ‘type coercion’ and identify instances when it occurs.Type coercion takes place when you automatically change a value into another value of a different data type.```var dog = "woof!";dog = 10;```Now the dog variable has a value of the number 10, and not the string "woof!".###Explain what the DOM is. Where does it live? What is it for? How does it get created?The DOM is the Document Object Model. It is the visual representation of a website and it is put together and lives in your local web browser. The DOM exists so that the visual representation of a website can be manipulated and attributes can be given to the objects within the DOM. The DOM is created by your browser and uses the HTML from the requested site to put the objects together.###Describe the CSS Box model. What 5 properties affect the box model?The CSS Box Model is the visual representation of an HTML element. It includes 5 different properties: padding, border, margin, height, and width. All of these affect how the HTML element is viewed and the space it has between the elements surrounding it. ###What is the difference between relative and absolute positions in CSS?Relative positioning refers to an objects position relative to the objects around it. This position can be adjusted in a few different ways (top, bottom, left, right).Absolute positioning refers to giving an object a set position on a page (using coordinates) that doesn't change. Absolute positioning takes into account the parent elements around the given absolute position. ###What is the difference between block and inline elements?A block element takes up the full width of its container.Inline elements can by inputted on the same line (next to each other).###What does each git command do? git add ., git commit -m “”, git push origin master```git add``` adds files to the staging area and starts to track changes made to them.```git commit -m ""``` takes the changes that have been made to the files in the staging area and moves them to wait for a push command. The listed command also lets you add a message to these changes.```git push origin master``` this takes the changes that have been committed and pushes them up to your github account and into the master branch of the given repository. In this example the local branch that you are pushing from is named "origin". The result of this command should be that both your local repository and the one on github match.  ###Git Branches: What are they? What are they used for?Branches allow different users to "checkout" versions of a file, make changes locally, then push the changes back to the master. Branches are usually used on larger projects where different team members might be working on different parts of an app independently and this way the product can stay whole while different changes are being made. Then the updated branches can be pushed back to the master. This allows numerous changes to be made at once instead of one contributor having to wait till the other is finished before making their changes.###What's the difference between git and github?Git is the language and Github is the online reference for collaboration.###Identify all of the truthy and falsy values in JS and explain what it means to be “truthy” and “falsy”.* Falsy - 0, "", false, null, undefined, NaN* Truthy - true, {}, [], a number greater than 0, "string"Falsy refers to the fact that a value does not exist where as truthy describes the opposite.###How do you access elements inside of an array?You can access elements in an array by calling on their indexes. For example, index[0] corresponds to the first element in the given array. You can use this logic to easily loop through arrays if you wish to access every element contained within. If an array contains arrays within arrays you can use the same logic. If you where to say index[0][1], this would correspond to the second element within the first element (array) within the given array.  ###What's the difference between arrays and objects?Arrays are like a list with indexes that allow you to accesses given elements. These elements can also be moved around, added, or deleted.Objects have some similarities to arrays but they have keys instead of indexes. Anything can be contained within and object. ###How do you create arrays and objects?An array simply uses [] and the elements are separated by commas. ```var arr = [0, 1, 2, 3];```An object uses brackets and key words for the values. ``` var obj = { key1: "value", key2: "value"};``` ###How do you access values inside an object?You access values inside an object by calling their keys. These are referred to as key value pairs. For instance, if I wanted to access the value of the first key in the object listed above I would say ```obj.key1``` and that would return ```"value"```.###Describe the three components of a for loop.First the loop is initialized and the given variable (usually i) is given a starting value. Then you have the conditional statement that will contain the loop and help to avoid an infinite loop. Finally there is the incrementing statement that says how much the loop variable should change after each cycle. ```for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++);```###Name three types of HTML mouse events."click", "dbclick", "mouseover".###What is event propagation?Event propagation can more specifically be defined as event bubbling. What this describes is the fact that a triggered event will "bubble" or move upwards in the DOM model and trigger other event listeners that might exist on parent elements. There are a couple different ways that you can manipulate event propagation. You can either stop it from bubbling at any given point or you can use its characteristics to add event listeners to many elements by placing a single listener on the parent. In this case the triggered event will always bubble up from the most specific (lowest level) element and you can use this information to specify which element was triggered.There is also a reverse to this called "Event Capturing" though it is rarely used.###What is npm?Node Package Manager allows users to share code with others in easily downloadable modules.###What are npm modules? How do you install an npm module?NPM Modules are files that contain code. By definition they are created so that they can be easily used for different purposes and modified. These are much easier to use than larger code segments or programs. NPM Modules can easily by installed from the command line by using the ```npm install``` command.###Describe the execution of a while loop and the potential for infinite loops.While loops run until the contained conditional statement turns false. This poses the potential risk for an infinite loop. Take the example below:```var i = 1;while (i > 0) {console.log("still going!");i++};```We define i as 1 and then increment it by +1 each time, which will count upwards by one each iteration. Because the conditional statement says "while i is greater than 0, keep running the loop", this process will never end and this loop will run until the end of time.
